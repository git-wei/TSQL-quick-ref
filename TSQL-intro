1. SQL has been there for over 50 years...

2. T-SQL is a SQL dialect used on MicroSoft SQL Server

3. MicroSoft SQL Server is a RDBMS of popularity

4. SQL server object hierarchy
	OS --> one or more SQL server instances --> one or more DBs --> one or more Schemas --> tables + views + store procedures (real objects)

5. Fully qualified object names
	Instance.Database.Schema.Object

6. MicorSoft SQL Server, the DBMS
   SQL Server Management Studio, SSMS, the IDE
   Azure Data Studio

7. SQL clause execution order
   1) FROM: Defines the source data set
   2) WHERE: Row filter
   3) GROUP BY: Combines rows into groups
   4) HAVING: Group filter
   5) SELECT: List of expressions to return
   6) ORDER BY: Presentation order
   7) OFFSET - FETCH: Paging specification 
Note: SELECT is to return/present the list of expressions

8. Rows : Tuples of elements of relation
   Rows are unique and are garanted by key
   Columns: Tuples of attributes
   A set by definition has no order, the rows have no order

9. Data types in T-SQL
   Numeric: integer, float, double
   Strings: string
   Binary: binary
   Temporal: date and time
   Hierarchy:
   Spatial:
   Document: unstructured data types, such as JSON and XML
   T-SQL does not have Interval and Boolean

10. For the FROM clause 
   For data in different data sets, need to use join
   CROSS JOIN: Cartisien product
   INNER JOIN: Cartisien product on conditions
   LEFT OUTER JOIN: 

11. For the WHERE clause
    NULL: missing or inapplicable data, marker/state but not a value!
    3VL (ternary) logic: True, False, Unknown
    Logical operators: AND, OR, NOT, =
                       ALL, x > ALL(A,B,C)
                       ANY/SOME, x > ANY|SOME (A,B,C)
                       IN, x IN (A,B,C)
                       BETWEEN, x BETWEEN A AND B
                       LIKE, x LIKE (<pattern>), '%' is wildcard represents zero or more characters

12. Grouping rows
    Common aggregate functions
		Minimum, Maximum, Average, Count, Standard deviation, Variance

13. SELECT expressions
	ALL will keep duplicate rows and is default
	DISTINCT will eliminate duplicate rows
	SELECT expressions executes at the same time for each row
	ISNULL(X,Y) function, if X IS NULL, return Y
	COALESCE(X,Y,Z) return the first known (not null)

14. Ordering and Paging
	A set being ordered is no longer a set, but a cursor
	Ordering is useful, but is not the responsibility of the DB
	Three tier architecture: presentation, business, database
	Ascending is default, and also indicate descending
	NULL in T-SQL assume the lowest ordering value

15. T-SQL has two ways to limit result sets
	TOP(N): Executed before SELECT expressions and after the DISTINCT
	OFFSET FETCH: LIMIT N OFFSET M
	OFFSET M ROWS FETCH NEXT N ROWS
